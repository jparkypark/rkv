## RKV Implementation Plan for Claude Code

### Project Setup & Structure

**Goal**: Create a command-line tool for structured professional development journaling

**Tech Stack**:

- **CLI Framework**: Commander.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Date Handling**: Luxon
- **File System**: fs-extra
- **Styling**: Chalk
- **Build Tools**: copyfiles (cross-platform file copying)
- **User Input**: inquirer

---

### Phase 1: Project Foundation ✅

**Completed**: Basic TypeScript project structure with dependencies, configuration system, and CLI entry point with placeholder commands.

**Key Components**:
- Project initialization with TypeScript and dependencies
- Configuration system (`src/config.ts`) with graceful error handling
- CLI entry point (`src/index.ts`) with Commander.js integration
- Basic folder structure for commands, utils, and templates

---

### Phase 2: Core Commands & Utilities ✅

**Completed**: Core file utilities, Obsidian integration, and fully functional `init` and `new` commands.

**Key Components**:
- File path utilities (`src/utils/files.ts`) with date handling and template processing
- Cross-platform Obsidian integration (`src/utils/obsidian.ts`)
- Interactive initialization command (`src/commands/init.ts`) with path validation
- Smart entry creation command (`src/commands/new.ts`) with template system
- Support for multiple entry types and date options

---

### Phase 3: Quick Capture System ✅

**Completed**: Full quick capture system with intelligent entry opening and timestamped logging.

**Key Components**:
- Quick capture command (`src/commands/log.ts`) with timestamped entries
- Smart entry opening command (`src/commands/open.ts`) with fallback suggestions
- Support for multiple date formats and keywords (today, yesterday, week, captures)
- Intelligent file selection (evening first, then morning)
- Helpful error messages and creation suggestions

---

### Phase 4: Build & Distribution ✅

**Completed**: Full build system with TypeScript compilation, template distribution, and global CLI availability.

**Key Components**:
- Complete build configuration with TypeScript compilation
- Template distribution system using copyfiles
- Global linking capability for development and testing
- Cross-platform build scripts and package configuration
- Comprehensive development and testing commands

---

### Project Status: Complete ✅

All phases have been successfully implemented and tested. The RKV CLI tool is fully functional with:

- **✅ Phase 1**: Project foundation with TypeScript configuration and CLI structure
- **✅ Phase 2**: Core commands (`init`, `new`) with template system and Obsidian integration  
- **✅ Phase 3**: Quick capture system (`log`, `open`) with intelligent file handling
- **✅ Phase 4**: Complete build system with global CLI distribution

### Current Capabilities

The RKV tool now supports:
- Storage-agnostic journal initialization
- Template-based entry creation with date options
- Quick capture logging with timestamps
- Smart entry opening with fallback suggestions
- Cross-platform Obsidian integration
- User-customizable templates

---

### Next Steps

Once core commands work:
1. Add `rkv review` for processing captures
2. Implement `rkv search` for finding entries
3. Add `rkv stats` for tracking consistency
4. Create `rkv report` for generating summaries
